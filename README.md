 Credit card companies must be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
 In this analysis, we focused on detecting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. The dataset contains 284,807 transactions with 31 features, including time, transaction amount, and variables V1 to V28. The target variable is 'Class,' where 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction and 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction.
